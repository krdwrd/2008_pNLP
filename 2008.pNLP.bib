  abstract	= {Originally conceived as a 'naive' baseline experiment
		  using traditional n-gram language models as classifiers,
		  the NCLEANER system has turned out to be a fast and
		  lightweight tool for cleaning Web pages with
		  state-of-the-art accuracy (based on results from the
		  CLEANEVAL competition held in 2007). Despite its
		  simplicity, the algorithm achieves a significant
		  improvement over the baseline (i.e. plain, uncleaned text
		  dumps), trading off recall for substantially higher
		  precision. NCLEANER is available as an open-source software
		  package. It is preconfigured for English Web pages, but can
		  adapted to other languages with minimal amounts of manually
		  cleaned training data. Since NCLEANER does not make use of
		  HTML structure, it can also be applied to existing Web
		  corpora that are only available in plain text format, with
		  a minor loss in classification accuracy.},
